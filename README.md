# Dart Asynchronous Operation Error Handling Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart: insufficient error handling within asynchronous operations, specifically using `http` for network requests and JSON decoding.  The original code lacks robustness, potentially leading to crashes or unexpected behavior when dealing with network failures or malformed JSON responses.

The `bug.dart` file showcases the problematic code.  The `bugSolution.dart` file presents a more robust solution addressing these issues.

## Bug Description

The primary issue lies in the incomplete handling of exceptions within the `fetchData` function.  While a `try-catch` block is present, it's not exhaustive. For instance, it fails to address potential issues with JSON decoding even if the HTTP request is successful.  Also, simply printing the error is insufficient for production-level applications. 

## Solution

The solution enhances error handling by:

*   **Specific exception handling:** Catches different exception types (e.g., `FormatException` for JSON decoding) and handles them appropriately.
*   **Informative error messages:** Provides more details about the type and source of errors.
*   **Considerate rethrowing:** Allows higher-level error handling mechanisms to deal with critical failures.
*   **HTTP error code handling**: Checks the HTTP response status code and handles non-200 codes specifically.
